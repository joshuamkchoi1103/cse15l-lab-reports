**Part 2 - Reflection**<br>
In the second half of this quarter, one thing I learned was how to use the VIM editor. I found it really cool that we don't need a code editor and we can edit code through the terminal window. For my CSE 12 class, I experimented with editing the code through VIM and running it through commands for fun and it was fascinating. Overall, I learned a lot from this class and my experience was wonderful with the help of the CSE 15L Staff!
